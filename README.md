Home Inventory application built using React JS as the frontend and Ruby on Rails handling the backend. The application was styled through a mixture of Ant Design components and custom styled-components. File uploading handled by both React-Dropzone and an uploader provided by Ant Design. 
The application is designed to assist a user in logging all items within their home, categorize these items by location in the home, and upload any supporting documentation to the items. The supported documentation includes pictures, warranties, insurance policies, etc. 
The Home component has detailed information about the user's home and gives the user the ability to add maintainence items, as well as upload current and future assessments of the property.
